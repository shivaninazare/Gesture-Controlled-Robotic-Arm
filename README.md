# Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Arm
Gesture based robotic arm prototype to pick and place objects by remotely controlling the model using mobile device using an application.

This repository consists of the -
1. Video of the working prototype.
2. apk file to control the model made using MIT app Inventor. 
3. Flowcharts for the model building are also been included.
4. Arduino code for the the microcontroller device (Arduino Mega ) that we used.
